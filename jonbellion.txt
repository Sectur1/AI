Still living in his dad's house, 24 years old
He could buy a few pads, but he just like to stay home
No, he never took the fast route, now the plaque’s on deck
But they still make him take the trash out, keep his ass in check
Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
His assistant is his best friend
Lost his dad that day
Really puts it in perspective
What the fuck's a bad day?
Sister told him "Keep your head right," 24 years old
Real women need love, fake bitches want gold
Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
All he needed was a platform, built a real fanbase
Took 'em with him when the deal came
Selling out in every state
Signed a deal after his first tape
But he kept it on the low
They can never say he sold out
So why they come to every show?
Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, we are the same
Nothing has changed (nothing)
All the same, we are the same
Nothing has changed, we are the same
We are the same
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
She said, "How does it feel to be you?"
I said, "It's alright, I really think I peaked in high school"
She said, "That isn't possible, you are out of your mind
Cause we never hooked up in high school"
We just need a night like
We just need a night like this, yeah
Take me back to 9th grade
Take me back to 9th grade shit, yeah
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
She said, "How'd we end up in the parking lot in Smithtown?"
The morning's on its way to sunrise
She said, "The island is long, but life is short in this town
I'm glad we got to redo the time"
We just need a night like
We just need a night like this, yeah
Take me back to 9th grade
Take me back to 9th grade shit, yeah
And just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
I can't let go and your lips feel retro
You're my Breakfast Club
You're my song from Cyndi Lauper
No more missed times, we fly by street signs
Let your hips rewind
Take me back into the future, yeah
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
I was the knight in shining armour in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate
I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I tried to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate
I, I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I tried to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low
I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken

Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York
New Yorker, in California, packed Brooklyn up in this bag
I'm in Malibu with the Bronx, she's in Kevin love with your man
Kryie needed a king, I'm just making you understand
What I rustle up in the West, cause my reach is Kevin Durant
Records are very pop with a pocket deeper than sand
A juxtaposition, Sam Cooke, Billy Joel, Steely Dan
Changing the fucking spectrum, I need you to understand
Like I took the fall for some drugs, I've been nominated for Grams (It's Grammy's)
Skinny genius got blueprints up in my hand
So the minute you hear my single, just know that it's in my plan
Advantage of demographics, I'm Jigga, Bruno and Sam Smith
I'm moving business, I'm Taylor Swift in a van
This game, boy, is very, very advanced
I'm very, very New York, be very, very aware
How very, very Dinero I can get on a snare
Letting go of your throat, I can sing the hook if you scared
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York
Meet me in the red dress when the stakes high, that's porterhouse
She's 5 foot 9 in a Rolls Royce, that's Slaughterhouse
Benny Hahn, Hahn's and a tall boy, we ordered out
The hell you need a chaser when all this liquor is watered down
Wait, see all them lines is fuck boy chat
Don't be so impressed by all that fuck boy rap
This money gon' leave you empty if you just want that
See, my joy lies in the son and you should jump on that
She'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one
But she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one
I'm not judging, here in the middle like I'm Malcolm, son
Verbal trigger like you should never play around with guns
Bow down to no crown, these goobers out for the count
Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding face in the lounge
Sober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd
With a thousand counting me out, but I'm here and killing the crowd now, blaow
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York
Let me give the kids just a little help
Tell 'em money is not the key to wealth
Cause if it can stop the pain
How the fuck did you explain the bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?
So you can take me off your winner's shelf
I got different vision, I'm bringing help
I know the demons in the room will say it's more that I can chew
But now all I hear is the dinner bell
I need a family that loves me right
Don't need a chain, don't need a club at night
I had a conversation with an angel
She told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life
Dropped off in the land where the artists play
Where God's way is the hardest way
Told myself I'm keeping my faith
If it costs me my reputation, then take it, I'll give it all away
I hit 'em with the boots in July
Bitch, I don't need snow
I gotta go bigger, I gotta go bigger
Five thousand on a coat cause it's fly
No, I don't speak broke
Still, I gotta go bigger, fuckin' go figure
There's an aching, there's a hole in my chest
It's amazing that the crown of a king doesn't change me
It's amazing
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Have I lost control? A voice says I might need my soul
But that's when I remember
That we all want, we all need fashion
Lost in it, livin' life through a phone
Now it's all I know
I gotta go bigger, I gotta go bigger
Yeah, five million dollar mans
It's a cure, stuck in high school mode
Still, I gotta go bigger, fuckin' go figure
There's an aching, there's a hole in my chest
It's amazing that the crown of a king doesn't change me
It's amazing
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Have I lost control? A voice says I might need my soul
But that's when I remember
That we all want, we all need fashion
Might be gold, but that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, but that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, but that shit's still a...
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Have I lost control? A voice says I might need my soul
But that's when I remember
That we all want, we all need fashion
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, might be gold
I wonder why I get paranoid when I’m high
I wonder why I say yes to everyone in my life
I wonder why I can’t run that fast in my dreams
I wonder why I feel short when I know my money’s tall
I wonder why I miss everyone and I still don’t call
I wonder why I can’t run that fast in my dreams
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn’t need faith
I guess if I never fell, I guess I wouldn’t need grace
I guess if I knew His plans, I guess He wouldn’t be God
So maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Maybe that’s okay, maybe that’s okay
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
I wonder why I feel emptiness and I sing these blues
I wonder why I feel hopelessness when I watch the news
I wonder why I can’t find my voice in my dreams
I wonder why they say hate your brother and hide your gold
I wonder why we all fear the things that we might not know
I wonder why I can’t find my voice in my dreams
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn’t need faith
I guess if I never fell, I guess I wouldn’t need grace
I guess if I knew His plans, I guess He wouldn’t be God
So maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Maybe that’s okay, maybe that’s okay
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
All this shit, I can’t explain
Is it by design or random fate, yeah
So maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Maybe that’s okay, maybe that’s okay
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Take your clothes and rip 'em, rip 'em off
Call these hoes and tip 'em, tip 'em off
You can tell them you are mine
I'm sick of, sick of games
No more time, you lit the, lit the flame
We live in an age where everything is staged
Where all we do is fake our feelings
I've been scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah
Need to let you know that
Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Take these walls and rip 'em, rip 'em down
Take my (uh) and zip 'em, zip 'em...
I will tell them I am yours and very, very proud
I am forced to give in, give in now
We live in an age where everything is staged
Where all we do is fake our feelings
I've been scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah
Need to let you know that
Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up

Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
We live in an age where everything is staged
And all we do is fake our feelings
I'm so scared to put myself so out there
Time is running out, yeah
Need to let you know that
Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Last night I woke the fuck up
I've realized I need you here, as desperate as that sounds, yeah-eh
Yeah, I think I got one
Her soul is presidential like Barack, son
Yeah, she call me Goose, I call her Maverick cause of Top Gun
They say we annoying, they just jealous cause we got love
Yeah, I got a hot one
She don't want no problem if there's not one
But people come around and try some stupid shit and start one
She give you the people's fuckin' elbow like The Rock, son
There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so
Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me
Hey, do I impress you?
I really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
When you working out and I'm just watching how your legs move
They would think that you was, like, developed in a test tube
You deserve a theme song
You could be the shoulder that I lean on
Love it when you're late for work and try to slip your jeans on
You be bumping Chili Peppers all up in your Nissan
There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so
Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
Cause everything about you is so
Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me
We're six feet underground inside my bed
And all the little letters in my head
We're spelling suicide but not by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise
Only the sound of my back breaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
The only friend I had wore black and red
The darker instruments inside my head
We're playing suicide but not by choice, by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise
Only the sound of my hands shaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
Don't hold the weight of the world
I don't hold the weight, I don't hold the weight
This the flow that helped me tip the scale
I'm stackin' chips like Chippendale's without the strippin'
Get the bailiff out cause Mr. Bellion's out to sell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin', equipped with the gift of spit
like the lisp on a chicken plate and a flick mixed with Spiderman
I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger
No one will shock the world, got a buzz like a mini Blanka
When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda
Got what it takes to be great, but can't hold this weight any longer
You know that he trusts you and I know that he loves you
But somehow you convinced me again
My foundation rumbles and all my morals crumble
My father's warnings run through my head
Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
One temptation sparked this
Now I can feel the darkness
It's my own fault but you had this planned
All of me, you take now, like criminals and shakedowns
Yeah, you make me forget who I am
Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me, hey
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me, hey
1600, 1600, 1600 on the SATs
Said they gettin', said they gettin'
Said they gettin' me an SUV
Just a couple miles from the lights of the city
Pour a little liquor in my Starbucks Venti
Just 11, just 11 when they said I had the ADD
I've been trying to keep up with all of these great expectations
So I keep on faking
We're secretly out of control, nobody knows it
But my mom's got a problem with oxy's and she's angry
Cause my dad's office door's always closed
But I stopped knocking
Yeah, we're secretly out of control and everyone knows
Oh, it's morning in America
Oh, it's morning in America
Oh, it's morning in America
Oh, it's morning in America
At the locker, at the locker
At the locker selling time release
Where's the party? Where's the party?
Where's the party? There's a house empty
Didn't learn a lesson, didn't use protection
Doesn't wanna keep the baby
Throwing up in the alley, in the alley
Older brother looking for me
I've been trying to keep up with all of these great expectations
So I keep on faking
We're secretly out of control, nobody knows it
But my mom's got a problem with oxy's and she's angry
Cause my dad's office door's always closed
But I stopped knocking
Cause there's some things I don't wanna know
We're secretly out of control, nobody says it
When the class president overdosed, we all pretended
It was rare, it was shocking and all the town was talking
Yeah, we're secretly out of control and everyone knows
Oh, it's morning in America
Oh, it's morning in America
And everyone knows
Oh, it's morning in America
Oh, it's morning in America
No, no, no, no...
We're secretly out of control, nobody knows me
And my friends all addicted to porn, can't keep a girlfriend
Cause the great expectations got all us imitating
Yeah, we're secretly out of control and everyone knows
We're secretly out of control, nobody knows it
But my mom's got a problem with oxy's and she's angry
Cause my dad's office door's always closed
But I stopped knocking

And everyone knows
Oh, it's morning in America
Oh, it's morning in America
And everyone knows
Sleep on me, feel the rhythm in my chest, just breathe
I will stay so the lantern in your heart won't fade
The secrets you tell me I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Kiss my lips, feel the rhythm of your heart and hips
I will pray so the castle that we've built won't cave
The secrets you tell me I'll take to my grave
There's bones in my closet, but you hang stuff anyway
And if you have nightmares, we'll dance on the bed
I know that you love me, love me
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
Guillotine, guillotine
Even when I lose my head
You fill me up, you fill me up

You fill me up, you fill me up
You set my soul ablaze
You fill me up even when I lose my head
My head spins and I've been sipping
I've been sipping, I've been sipping lately
All my sins, I've been tripping, I've been tripping, my God
Brand new life, I've been looking
I've been looking, I've been looking lately
All these nights, they've been cooking
They've been cooking me raw
I am just a man, I am just a man
Who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes I lose my way
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe
Don't lose faith
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Break it down
Your whole life's in the hand of
Your whole life's in the hand of God
My ex girl, I've been seeing, I've been seeing
I've been seeing lately
She's got hopes that we're getting back together, my God
I just know that I'm horny and I'm lonely, just admit it's crazy
She just holds on to something that she knows is long gone
Damn...
I am just a man, I am just a man
Who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes I lose my way
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change

Don't lose faith
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Break it down

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Overwhelming
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Overwhelming
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I did everything for New York
I dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me
I dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me
I dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me
Who the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?
You're still the only thing I've done right
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
I just want me and you inside real life
(I just want me and you inside real life)
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight

A song a day for six years seems like lightyears away from today (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Too many coincidences and instances of God's hand, it's insane (hey, hey, hey, hey)
I thought my way to greatness, I could claim this, but he gave me the brain (hey, hey, hey, hey)
And those thoughts can get confusing, it's amusing
But tonight, we celebrate (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Lay me down
Put me out
Call me home
Let me know
I'm ready to go
'Cause I was down
Now I've flown
Oh, what's reality lately?
Remember dreams seemed far away
Was pinching pennies like Lane and Hardaway
But now my beats make fees for holidays in Greece
And I don't mean John Travolta
Remember dreams seemed far away
Was pinching pennies like Lane and Hardaway
But now my beats make fees for holidays in Greece
And I don't mean John Travolta
And I don't mean John Travolta (yeah)
And I don't mean John Travolta
Dancing under sunset, in the mountains, just reflecting for today
I've seen this in my head a million times
But to see it come to life is just insane (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Champagne and orange juice, mimosas were Pulp Fiction in the way (hey, hey, hey, hey)
That all can get confusing, it's amusing but tonight (celebrate)
Lay me down
Put me out
Call me home
Let me know
I'm ready to go
'Cause I was down
Now I've flown
Oh, what's reality lately? (oh)

I'm ready to go
You already know how we came up
I'm saying it was a real pain in the butt
If there's paper to touch, you may just cut just scraping it up
Get your trachea cut and then escape in a truck
Smudge a lady makeup, bang the 380, wake the baby up
I just came for the weight like a gymnasium
I'm finna spray everything in my radius
Lately, my skin been looking radiant
The Mercedes is '80s sent
I have three 6's in my fade like Damian
I'd die before I let the jakes take me in
Babe, we everything we say we is (facts)
My stable of women couldn't fit in the stadium
They sayin' me and Jon Bellion we some aliens
And durags had us looking like Saudi Arabians
Your way miscellaneous, we some ladies men
It's Roc, Marcberg be the alias
Now let's begin
Was never focused on getting bigger, just getting better
That's why I keep getting bigger after every record
Said I got lucky the last record that y'all was blessed with
Watch me give you sequels, I'm Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon
I let the talent speak volumes, that's why there's different levels
I stopped the flexin' on socials, corny shit to impress you
You get too famous, then everything in your life is stressful
There's a big difference between being known and being successful
Great grandfather, an immigrant from the Naples district
Dirty Guinea crew in the cut, call that the true incision
My wife thicker than liquor soaked in Italian biscuits
Cookin' Minestrone every Sunday, call that a superstition
I left LA just to cook in Brooklyn, the winter's reaper
I sleep in Timbs and a Yankee fitted, that's just for leisure
I'm really better than everybody pretends to be
So ask the label now, why the fuck would I want an urban feature?
"I love the song and we really wanna know how you made it"
Or I could keep all you wondering how we been creatin'
It's annoying when cameras catching your every statement
And I've had enough of these corny artists that replicate it
Champagne supernovas destroy the morning glory
I'd rather build an oasis sober and thrive at 40
Don't get me wrong, I've been celebrating the life before me
But I see the wisdom in moderation for certain stories
When you're afraid to hurt feelings, you water down the worth
I'm done pretending your record's great and I'm down to work
Plus I'll be actress and mixed with sociopaths
And when I'm worried about being famous for being down to earth
I spoke with Yahweh, he told me Jesus crafted us in
Which means my brother's my brother, it don't matter the skin
America needs to watch how they treat his chosen people
But that's for deeper than surface records, now let's begin
Now let's begin
Yeah
Now let's begin
Foot on the gas, foot on your neck
One mansion, others gasping for a breath
I'm unclassed, capital punishment blast back
What you tumblin', trash rappers who mumblin' for respect
I'm uncheckable, wide open, the foul technical
Go full press, I still glide like Clyde Drexler do
I'm done testin' two times over, I'll get the best of you
Better pay attention, two eyes open wide when I execute
And I been waiting so long that you asked for this
You try to give me your table scraps, I'ma give you my ass to kiss
I won't even wait for the death, you'll get faded right after this
A masochist who ready to face the masses like Catholics
And you can tell the whole school I'm prepped for the glory
In the presence of your professor, attendance is mandatory
With a weapon, freshman semester
You test the mess and get gory
I'm just here to kill the game, let the messenger tell the story
Now let's begin
Now let's begin
Arms in the sky, I'm feeling angel high
Funk got me sanctified
Sent to the light, come save your soul tonight
Funk got me sanctified
Funk got me sanctified
Funk got me sanctified
Arms in the sky, I'm feeling angel high
Funk got me sanctified
Sent to the light, come save your soul tonight
Funk got me sanctified
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done, yeah
Were just attempts at earning love? Yeah
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, stupid deep
What if where I've tried to go was always here?
And the path I've tried to cut was always clear?
Why has life become a plan, yeah
To put some money in my hand?
When the love I really need is stupid cheap, stupid cheap
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done
Were just attempts at earning love? Yeah
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done (What if all the things I've done)
Were just attempts at earning love?
Though the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep
Deep
Life became dangerous the day we all became famous
No one cares if you're happy, just as long as you claim it, oh
How can we change this? The day we all became famous
No one cares if you have it, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the foot, just need you to think I can get
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the what, just need you to think I hit it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the good, just need you to think I did it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the good, don't need the good, don't need it
Life became dangerous the day we all became famous
No one cares if you're happy, just as long as you claim it, oh
How can we change this? The day we all became famous
No one cares if you have it, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Uh, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the word, just need you to think I said it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need to learn, just need you to think I get it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the sermon, just need you to think I read it
(La-la-la-la-la)
I don't need the sermon, don't need the sermon, don't need it
Life became dangerous the day we all became famous
No one cares if you're happy, just as long as you claim it, oh
How can we change this? The day we all became famous
No one cares if you have it, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Uh, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do
No real estate in the real world
How can you stop something not even there?
No real estate in the real world
We're going down and we don't even care
(Life became dangerous)
No real estate in the real world
(The day we all became famous)
How can you stop something not even there?
(How can we change this?)
No real estate in the real world
(No one cares if you have it)
Just as long they think you do, woo
Just as long they think you do, ooh
Uh, just as long they think you do, ooh
Just as long they think you do
Messing with my pride, thinking anytime
You could just get up and go
Then I realize what the hell is love
If you're in complete control?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Sucked up by the wave, shot to outer space
Stranded, but I'm not alone
Fall into your blu
Fall into your blu
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blu
Sunrise in your bed, purple, yellow, red
Only when it's you and me
Take me to the edge, drag me through your lens
Show me what I need to see
Hey ma, hey ma, hey, hey ma, hey ma
Hey, come to my house and take me home
Avenues and lanes, parachutes and planes
Push me out, away we go
Fall into your blu
Fall into your blu
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blu
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
(Come to my house and take me home)
Come to my house and take me home
Come to my house and take me home
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fall into your blu
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fall into your blu
(Come to my house and take me home)
Fighting it is hopeless, sinking in your ocean
Just like He designed me to do
Fall into your blu
TUAMIE has developed a new hyperbolic time chamber
Here on Namek, we'll be focusing on the mental
Training starts now, begin
Ooh, I've just been fanning myself, I'm a such a fan of myself
There's levels to the cool like a fan on a shelf
When you blow, they try to gas you like fans at the Shell station
God hands me a full plate, but I handle it well
If they don't feel your thoughts, start dreaming in braille
They'll try to sell you short 'cause their dreams are for sale
They'll say "Get off your podium, life isn't Nickelodeon"
Aren't you so dumb? Kenan and Kel" Wow
The government leaves an animal trail
So I switch to swiss-charred, carrots and kale
So I'll remember my kid's name, dementia is a sick game
I'm silence in the lamb, call me Hannibal Failed, yeah
Financial plans should be handled in stealth
I fight to leave the private life for my family's health
Got some dinner with art collectors, they started drinkin' Prosecco
When they slipped about their level of family wealth
Bunch of actresses downplay how my records have felt
It's not a mystery to decode a fanning yourself
"This man's on fire," I can't pretend I'm not talented
For me to fake humble's a corny way to be arrogant
Drug dealers still on the corner of Madison
Except they push Pradas and Red Bottoms to medicines
Red bottoms for baboons and radishes
I went to Mozambique and saw a real kind of happiness
So I don't feel guilty when Nike sends me some packages
We still end up in boxes even though we chase packaging
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift
I can't fall off, I got a great grip
Go and find some talent, have a great trip
This Bellion guy's power level's amazing
Uh, take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift
Prepare to fight
My stance here is a band leader is Pangaea
My heart free-er, I'm cold, heater than Cambria
I rock steady, my Johnson's Dwayne-heavy
We just erase heroes, I Stan Lee your remedy, he the
King of Queens, my balls breathe Lebron's Kia
I carry greatness, statements on spaceship, Haitians get lace and
Meaning you dread what comes from my third eye
Blind to the fake shit (Wow)
My tone is gettin' aggressive, I just create for the truly gifted of adolescense
My essence becomes the mystery
I instantly become a Pistol Pete in sport full of Walt Fraziers
My Kelsey Grammer is something like Forward Ham
Like Alfred Hitchcock with a camera
Just blazin' Killer Cam
Family candle can't handle it
My channel too hot to cancel, my babies drivin' a Mansell
I'm passenger writin' stanzas, I'm holdin' these verses ransom
I'm Hansel Zoolander handsome
TUAMIE supply the face lift
It's all because of (Jesus)
Well done, welcome to Glory Sound Prep
I'm lovin' it all, here with my brother-in-law
Greece is a beautiful place, food is incredible, awe
We just been playin' some games, everyone's pickin' a straw
Who gets the longest has gotta go tell the butler to call
For more alcohol
Wait, we'd told the locals that we'd go and play basketball
But they don't want the business
Plus, I drank from the flask we bought, now everything is spinnin'
Now we laugh it off
Ooh, it's Whoopie Goldberg the way that my sisters act up
They had some champagne, now everybody's laughing
Movies 'bout paradise, and my family got the cast thing
If you dove into the tears of my eyes, you'd hear this instrumental
Jesus was instrumental in blessing my mental
Every time I drove a car, could've twisted the metal
All the things on my wishlist, God has given in triplets
I'm on an island where opiates go to rich kids
And then they pass away, that's called death over the privileged
Yeah, I never wanna be famous, stop calling me underrated
I'm still pushin' the same whip, I was drivin' in Sachem
Peace in my life, it's awesome, As-salamu alaykum
I'm makin' certain decisions, I'm flyin' under the radar
I really love my life and this music thing is a great job
Yeah, pick up the phone and someone tells me, "Mr. Bellion, sir
Beyoncé on the line, she tryna reach you on your cellular"
She wanted "Fall In Line," but we gave it to Aguilera, uhh
I hope it's the right decision, Bey wanted it for the twins she signed
I hope I didn't burn that bridge, I worry all the time
I'm just tryna show these kids about this slight of mine
I always flex, but I realize that it's divine appointment
I'm a cross between hard work and Jesus-annointed
I hope the ceiling that needed grace is the final notion
For the rest of my life, you'll see me on the L-I-double R
With a Heineken in my bag, on my way to the Gardens
Tryin' to kill your nephews like I been fuckin' with Star
Me lyin' down on the job is not an option at all
On my way to the Garden...
On my way to the...
On my way to the Gar...
I might have been tired, you might have been hungry
I might have said something, you might have done nothing
You know you still love me
I might have been wired, you probably need coffee
I know I keep chips on my shoulder like dips
So come get it off me
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
I want to get
I want to get
You crashed in my car, I fucked up vacation
I tried to change this, and you tried to change that
But it's just in our nature
I desperately care, you're hopelessly on me
I try to stay pissed, and you try to stay mad
'Til I grab your hips softly
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
I want to get
I want to get
I want to get close
Let me get close, let me get close
I want to get close
Let me get close, let me get close
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Toda la era con cadera que todo va pagado
I want to get
I want to get (close)
I want to get (close)
Heard he was born as a beast and a ghost
On the East of a coast, where they eat you for jokes, uh
I know a guy who said his mom knew a man
Who's mother's sister saw him in the mall one time
Heard he was high and he rode to the sky
And it opened and God played a song he recorded
He wrote it down
But he only play the record for his wife sometimes
Heard he survived, on an island with Vikes
That provided with Valkyrie, sirens, and pirates
Don't know the guy, yeah uh
But they talk about his verses in the night sometimes
Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Heard he was formed from the lights that are Northern
The rock that's above, though he once got an offer
From Lucifer's daughter to bow to the gods
So he keep his verses sharper than a knife sometimes
Heard he was worn, not a hero that's torn
Between fame and adornment and loses his sword
So he shot the fame down
But he keep a mask on him if the sign's in the sky
Heard he was happy so no one could gas him
Or force him to dance like a monkey for access
He loves his life
But he keep a pen sharp enough to write one time
Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Big reign, the sixth, the seven
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
Bang bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the King, the Legend
He struck down gods that he killed and armies
Stood up on top of a hill of bodies
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
Put up both hands, made the lightning come down
Rep got so big that it blocked the sun out
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
The King, the Legend
Himself
The King, the Legend
The King, the Legend
Been watching you for months and I'm tryin' to find a way now
To tell you what I'm seeing, it's heavy on my brain now
It's only moving faster, you're only sinking farther
I see it in your eyes now, it's only getting harder
There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a "sorry" that you faked to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother to her mom
Conversations with the devil and he's telling me
What's the point in making memories when you can't even find 'em when you're 70?
Conversations with my father and he's telling me
There's a point in making memories 'cause they'll be even better when we're heavenly
There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a "sorry" that you faked to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother
When my mother was a mother
When my mother was a mother to her mom
For the mothers who are with us physically
Physically
Mama, mama
Mama, mama, mama
Mama, mama
