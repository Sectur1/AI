To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking
Damn
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something
Damn
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me,
I like me better when I'm with you yes I do, yes I do, babe
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you
I like me, I like me
Look who you made me, made me,
Better when
I like me better when I'm with you
All I know is
We could go anywhere, we could do
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
All I know is
Getting lost late at night, under stars
Finding love standing right where we are, your lips
They pull me in the moment, you and I alone and
People may be watching, I don't mind
Cause
Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
Cause anywhere, babe
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you
Paris in the rain
I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
Feelings they come and they go, that they do
Feelings they come and they go, not with you
The late nights and the street lights and the people
Look at me, girl, and the whole world could stop
Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town
Or bottles that we can't pronounce
Is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you
Paris in the rain
Girl, when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight
Days in Paris, nights in Paris
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
Yeah, isn't it obvious, isn't it obvious?
So come and set the mood right
Underneath the moonlight
Cause anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like
Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet
Laying here wrapped in white just trying to not fight again
'Cause I’ve been holding on too long just to let it end
 I must be walking on eggshells
Trying not to sell myself out
I bet that’s what she’s thinking
That’s when she said
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 
Trying my best to show appreciation,  yeah
But all apologies are just a miscommunication
Now it’s like I’m walking on eggshells
Trying not to burn the hell out
It’s like pulling magic from my mouth
That’s when she said
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 
Could I ever do enough to make this coffee more than bitter water?
Could I ever do enough to make you wear this love not like a collar?
Could I ever do enough to make you feel the way you want to feel?
So the next time that you’re sad, tell me that…
Do you want it bad?
Uh yeah, baby do ya? 
Do you want it bad?
Yeah she said, baby do ya? 
Or are you just comfortable? 
Are you just comfortable? 
Smile when you're sleeping
Wonder who you're dreaming of
, 'cause I could just see you with wine on your t-shirt
And somebody else on your arm
Can't control this feeling
Wonder who you're dreaming of
After all of these nights laying right by your side
How could my brain make me feel so far?
Maybe it's a case of paranoia
Nervous that I'll never really know ya
What do I feel? Who do I trust?
Maybe it's real, or maybe I'm just...
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just
Never felt so naked
Lookin' at you naked
Got your hands down the back of my soul
And the more that I show you, the more I'm afraid
That you're going to wake up
And realize I'm not the one
That you thought I was, that I thought I was
Am I who I am who am I?
Maybe it's a case of paranoia
Nervous that I'll never really know ya
What do I feel? Who do I trust?
Maybe it's real, or maybe I'm just...
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just
Paranoid
Maybe I'm just
Crazy
But baby, I love you
And baby I'd love to not be...
Paranoid, mm
I wish I wasn't
Paranoid, mm-mm
Maybe I'm just–
Like a spotlight the water hits me
Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
Though I know that no one’s listening
I nervously rehearse for when you're around
And I keep waiting like you might change my mind
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty
Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head
Though I know that our time is ending
, I'd rather lay forever right in this bed
And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind
Give me one more night
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
No one knows Knows
We fell from the peak
And the stars, they broke their code
I'm trying to forget
How I landed on this road
I'm caught in between
What I wish and what I know
When they say that you just know
Who wrote the book on goodbye?
There's never been a way to make this easy
When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right
Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire
No one knows
You set the other on fire
Didn't wanna be a ghost
But you pushed me over and over
Never thought I'd have a vice
Other than you, over and over
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
just so I can reforget
I never thought a sunrise
Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight
Head spins like carousel, over and over
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
I go out just so I can reforget
Two more footsteps on the wood floor, but it ain't you
I'm faded so I bring someone home
Over and over, I do this and I'm still
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and regret
just so I, can reforget
Stick, stick to your stones 'cause that's all you know
I was caught in the middle
I swallow my words down to the bone
Cause nothing's that simple
Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down
But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah
We all know
The story never ends, ends
Wound me like a toy spinning too fast
In every direction
How, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?
Late at night, you pour it out
Know that only brings you down
But go ahead give me all the blame
Twist my words and set them to flame, woah
We all know
That you'll go tell all of your friends
That I'm the one you wish you never met
And woah
We all know
The story never ends, ends
That’s who you are
Crash the car
And blame the road
Never your fault
After all
I would know
The story never ends
The story...
The story never ends, ends
I thought we said we're good
Was I misunderstood?
You lookin' at me so cold
After all that we've been through
How could you pretend?
I'm someone that you don't know
I'm so sick of planning all my nights, nights
'round avoiding you, it's gotta end
We don't have to love again or try, try
But can you tell me
, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through, yeah
, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
You see me walkin' towards
You're headed for the door
Why is your shoulder so cold?
I know it's hard to speak
With all our history
But that don't mean you should go
I'm so sick of planning all my nights, nights
'round avoiding you it's gotta end
We don't have to love again or try
But can you tell me
, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through
, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
, tell me why did, why did we
Throw away the love we had?
And tell me why do, why do we
Love to make it hurt so bad
Yeah, I know that we can't be friends
But after all the things we been
, why do we, we have to be enemies? 
, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies?
Forget all the scars, all that they are
Memories, memories
, I know it hurts 'cause I feel it too
But after all, all that we been through, yeah
, why do we, we have to be
Enemies, enemies
Doubt, doubt, doubt
It kills everything that you love
Now, now, now
I’m losing myself on the run
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
 the sun burned it on clear
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home
Paint-chipped skies
Nothing is ever as it seems
Behind these codeine eyes
Blind to the world in between
And I flew to California
Thought I could leave
Every piece of you right here
Yeah I flew to California
Still wide awake
 the sun burned it on clear
How I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
But I still love you
I still love you
But sometimes you have to go
Trade your heart for bones
To know you need to come back home
Come back home
Getaway
I always thought I needed a getaway
It's not me you're really mad at
I see it in your eyes
She's always had you pissed off
And you hold it deep inside
I'm telling you to let go, let go
You told me give you a chance
To feel the way you feel, but so you know
Even if I don't quite understand
Even if I'm blind, I'll pay no mind
Baby, I'll stand
Even when you drive me half, you drive me half insane
If you promise that and then it's not in vain
If you'll always do the same for me
I won't question, question it
You think I'm oblivious
Maybe that's true
I don't notice, my heart is too focused
On trying to do right by you, by you, by you
I can't control the actions, actions
Of somebody else
Don't give them satisfaction, no
Just leave them on the shelf,  baby
You know I'll stand
Even if I'm blind, I'll pay no mind
Baby, I'll stand
Even when you drive me half, you drive me half insane
If you promise that and then it's not in vain
If you'll always do the same for me
I won't question, question it
Why do LA girls always have this attitude from out of nowhere?
Turning nothing into something,  girl please don't go there
I even changed my number, I don't know how they're still calling
Just come back to bed, I'll fix all this shit in the morning
It's nothing I can't handle, don't wanna waste these candles
As soon as we get done another one like Khaled's sandals
First thing I'll do is make sure you won't ever second guess it
You know I love you, that ain't a question
I won't question, question it
I'll always
Put it down, down, down for you baby
You got a way of makin' me feel insane
Like I can't trust my own brain
Unless it's screaming your name
I'd have it no other way
And maybe that's why I stay
How many times can we pick up the same fight?
Can we keep screaming all night
And make up until it's light?
That's when I say that you're right
And feel your body on mine
 maybe that's why I stay
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
Keep comin' back, guess you could say I'm attached
Last time we called it a wrap, I came beggin' and all that
You're like a habit, it's bad
I got a habit, it's bad
 no, I'm not even mad
I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
It's the way you keep me up all night
It's the way you make me lose my mind
Every time I'm sayin' one more night
It's the way you know I'm yours for life
'Cause I could be somewhere chillin' on the beach
I could be with someone makin' me happy
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
I could put my phone down, just pick up my keys
I could let you go, and we could let it be
But that would be too easy, love
And I don't want no easy love
Remembering what you said
Now I'm laying alone in bed
Trying to wrap up this feeling
Falling apart instead
'Cause baby we hit the top
Sweeter than sugar rocks
Holding onto a moment
Let go, I'm falling off
I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot to get into it

Keep calling me home
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that we’ve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline
Remembering all those nights
With your body straight to the sky
You work me until the morning
Fall asleep half past nine A.M.
So crazy in love
Enough was never enough
Tell me our touch ain’t dull now
I just need a little of it
Need a little, not a lot to get into it

Keep calling me home
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that we’ve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline
And I don’t know where the ceiling is anymore
No, I don’t know where the feeling is anymore
Can we go back to adrenaline?
Girl you know that we’ve been settling, settling
But I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline
Can we go back from here?
Anymore,
Can we go back from here?
Anymore
Can we go back from here?
'Cause I need to feel, need to feel it
Adrenaline
I wanna hate you 'cause I still love you
And it's weighing on my chest
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's coming next
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good way, yeah there's no good way
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you, you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
I wanna feel you, really feel you
Not just hold you close at night
We keep our bodies tied together
To ignore what's on our minds, yeah
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
And there's no good way, yeah there's no good way
[Chorus]
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you, you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way
I was driving you home in the middle of the night
But I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
I was driving you home
Even if I go, even if I stay
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you, you
You got that something that I never wanna lose, lose, yeah
It's like dancing when the song's already over
Moving without getting any closer, 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way
Keep chasing fire
No other way, no other way
I've watched those eyes light up with a smile
River in the not good times
, you taught me all that I know I know
I've seen your soul grow just like a rose
Made it through all of those thorns
Girl into the woman I know
And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
When I really mean, mean to say...
You're my all and more
All I know you taught me, yeah
You're my all and more
But I need room to breathe, yeah
I found New York laying in your arms
We'll melt into the bedroom floor
Never knew I'd stay for so long
And this truth cuts not through one, but both
Not through one, but both of us
But it's deeper if I hold on
And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
When I really mean, mean to say...
You're my all and more
All I know you taught me, yeah
You're my all and more
But I need room to breathe, yeah
Gotta breathe for me, it's now or never
O--
I should leave, 'cause you deserve better, better
Gave my all and more
But I need room to be me
You're my all and more
All I know you taught me, yeah
You're my all and more
But I need room to breathe, yeah
Breathe
Didn't know what I wanted, I'll admit that
Still don't know what I'm wantin'
I'll be honest, I'm not ready to let you go
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more
, why did I say goodbye?
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need you
Anyway I could toss it, I'll admit that
That don't mean that I need to
Keep you wrapped around my wrist
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more
, why did I say goodbye?
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
All I know is I can’t face it 
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it 
And another day is passing by
, I still need you
And another day is passing by
All of these Melatonin tears I cry
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
All I know is I can't face it
I used to have you, now I have this bracelet
I let you go but baby, I'm gonna wear it
Until I don't need to
I walk down memory lane late at night
I end up losing my way every time
I wake up missing you more, missing you more
, is it goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Is it goodbye?
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Missing you more , why?
Running from the morning
Think I hit a wall
Late nights, not you
Running from the moment
So I don't recall
Late nights, not you
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I'd do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I'll ever let go
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is

Drowning in my coffee
To wash the alcol
Out my bloodstream
Sitting here I wonder
If we hadn't been at all
Who would I be?
Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
And I wonder if I'll ever let go
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you
Getting over you
I tried spending my nights under someone new
But the truth is

We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself, seventeen
Then you came, found me
No other magic could ever compare
There's a room
In my heart with the memories we made
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames
There's no way I could ever forget, mmm
For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mmm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one
And no matter what I-I do, o, mmm
I will never not think about you
What we had only comes
Once in a lifetime
For the rest of mine, always compare
To the room
In my heart with the memories we made
Nights on fifth, inbetween B and A
There's no way I could ever forget, mmm
For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mmm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I loved, I knew you were the one
And no matter what I-I do, o, mmm
I will never not think about you
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun, looking back?
We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Call you one time, two time, three time, I can't wait no more
Your fingers through my hair, that's on my mind
I know its been a minute since you walked right through that door
But I still think about you all the time
I don't know, I don't know how I'm gonna make it out
I don't know, I don't know how you got me sayin'
Fuck, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely as
Fuck, come hold me, come hold me, come hold me
It's been me, myself and why did you go, did you go? 
Fuck, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, I
Yeah I still watch the shows you showed me, I still drink that wine
But these days it tastes more bitter than sweet Hmm
And all my friends are way too drunk to save me from my phone
So sorry if I say some things I mean
I don't know, I don't know how I'm gonna make it out
I don't know, I don't know now you got me sayin'
Fuck, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely as
Fuck, come hold me, come hold me, come hold me
It's been me, myself and why did you go, did you go? 
Fuck, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, I
Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over
Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over you
Get over you
Fuck, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely as
Fuck, come hold me, come hold me, come hold me
It's been me, myself and why did you go, did you go? 
Fuck, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, I
Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over you
Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over you
She was sixteen the first time
She had her heart broken
Truth is, I've never had mine
Now she goes on vacation
In expensive places
To get away from her mind
I don't mean to be rude
There's things in myself that I see in you
Lonely eyes
She had those lonely eyes
I only know 'cause I have them too
Lonely eyes
No, you don't have to hide
The things you feel inside, I feel too
'Cause I'm lonely just like you
Bask in all of the silence
In between our eyelids
Where you are, I'm right there too
We might speak different languages
And we might have differences
But where you are, I'm right there too
I don't mean to be rude
There's things in myself that I see in you
Lonely eyes
She had those lonely eyes
I only know 'cause I have them too
Lonely eyes
No, you don't have to hide
The things you feel inside, I feel too
'Cause I'm lonely just like you
Stay the night, stay the week
When you're gone, I don't sleep
When you're gone, I feel weak, 
Stay the night, stay the week
When you're gone, I don't sleep
When you're gone, I feel weak, 
Lonely eyes
She had those lonely eyes
I only know 'cause I have them too 
Lonely eyes
No, you don't have to hide
The things you feel inside, I feel too
'Cause I'm lonely just like you 
I'm lonely just like you
Stay the night, stay the week
When you're gone, I don't sleep
I'm lonely just like you
When you're gone, I feel weak, 
I wish that you and I lived in the Sims
We could build a house and plant some flowers and have kids
But we're both at some trashy Halloween party downtown
And I'll probably never see you again
I wish that we lived on a VHS
I'd erase the things I said and that I'll probably say again
Hit rewind on all the times I got lost in my head
But I guess I'll never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
O, goddamn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
Maybe, then
I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah, o, goddamn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
In another life, baby
In another
I wouldn't have let you, I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you, I wouldn't have let
I wish that we met walkin' round the MoMA
Yeah, I'd say nice to meet you, 'stead of saying nice to know you
I'd try to impress you with some bullshit 'bout Monet
At least I wouldn't be too drunk to stay
And I wouldn't have let you slip away
O, goddamn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
Maybe, then
I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah, o, goddamn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
In another life, baby
In another, uh
I wouldn't have let you, I wouldn't have let you leave me
Is my love too much,
Or is it just enough,
For you, for you?
'Cause it's getting late
Would you like to stay? Ha-ah
'Cause I'm bad at reading signs
But I...
I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
If you want it too
Girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind
'Cause feelings are hard to find
But I feel 'em in my chest
A tiny war within
But when I pull you closer
Girl, I can't explain
But I...
I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
If you want it too
Girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind
'Cause feelings are hard to find
'Cause feelings are hard, yeah
And I know, and I know
That it hurts sometimes
When I'm with you
And I know, and I know
That it hurts sometimes
When I miss you
And I know, and I know
That it's on your mind
When I kiss you
But...
I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
I wanna do
Whatever you wanna do
If you want it too
Girl, we could cross that line
Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind
Small talk, no conversation
That look makes me impatient
I can't tell what you're thinkin'
Please tell me what you're thinkin'
Last night we were more than fine
Just tell me if you changed your mind
If you changed your mind mi-i-ind
'Cause I'm all, I'm all in
I'm callin', no answer
But you text me when you feel like,
When it feels right to you
But I'm all, I'm all in
I'm fallin' faster
But if you're looking at me with a
Heart of doubt
Don't kiss me right now
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don't run me round and round
Don't build me up just to let me
Down, just to let me
Down, down, down eh
Don't mess with my head
Don't tell me you're falling
With your feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath, baby
Don't run me round and round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me
Right now, on your lips just leave it
If you don't mean it
Ah, yeah
You know you got me in the palm of your hand
But I love those hands
Ah, yeah
But you only let me hold you when he can't
Yeah, I don't understand
'Cause I'm all, I'm all in
I'm callin', no answer
But you text me when you feel like,
When it feels right to you
But I'm all, I'm all in
I'm fallin' faster
But if you're looking at me with a
Heart of doubt
Don't kiss me right now
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don't run me round and round
Don't build me up just to let me
Down, just to let me
Down, down, down eh
Don't mess with my head
Don't tell me you're falling
With your feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath, baby
Don't run me round and round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me
Right now, on your lips just leave it
If you don't mean it
"Hurry home, let's never leave the house"
But you don't mean it
"Let's stay in bed while all our friends go out"
But you don't mean it
Why you let those words come out your mouth?
If you don't mean it
You've been staring at me with a heart of doubt
Ah-ah
Don't kiss me right now
Don't tell me that you need me
Don't show up at my house
All caught up in your feelings
Don't run me round and round
Don't build me up just to let me
Down, just to let me
Down, down, down eh
Don't mess with my head
Don't tell me you're falling
With your feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath, baby
Don't run me round and round
Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me
Right now, on your lips just leave it
If you don't mean it
Do you still remember
The way that we felt when we were kids?
Wonder if that place still exists, mmm
We lived for the moment
And fear was a stranger to our lips
I wonder if that place still exists
Yeah, we built castles out of couches
Felt fire without matches
Made promises without fear of getting burned
Now we're always second guessing
We think happy is expensive
But every time I'm with you I re-learn
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
It's the way that I feel when I, when I hold you close
'Cause everything that was, , it comes and goes
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
So let me hold you close
Do you remember
The last time you felt something like this?
The way that it felt when we were kids
Yeah, we built castles out of couches
Felt fire without matches
Made promises without fear of getting burned
Now we're always second guessing
We think happy is expensive
But every time I'm with you I re-learn
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
It's the way that I feel when I, when I hold you close
'Cause everything that was, , it comes and goes
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
So let me hold you close
Way I feel and the way we kiss
Swear that nothing else
In the world exists
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
It's the way that I feel when I, when I hold you close
'Cause everything that was, , it comes and goes
It's the invisible things that I, that I love the most
So let me hold you close
Way I feel and the way we kiss
Swear that nothing else
In the world exists
'Cause I'ma cross my heart
If we both forget
To leave out the dark
And remember this
All you need is someone, all you need is someone
I could've sworn it was a dream
When I kissed your lips and fell
Uh, saw a different side of me
Ah, it's like I didn't hate myself
At first, I thought that he was just a friend
But then I heard that you were loving him
You broke my heart and I don't really think that you mind, mind
Build me up and turn me on
You played me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine, o
You made me feel like I was yours
You made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
Woo!
 yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah
So crossed my heart and hope to die
Never date a girl like you
After all the shit you put me through
Yeah, all you ever did was lie
Pants on fire, pants on fire
Guess you can't find love in Mollywood
No, you can't find love when you're searching for better
Hope you find something better, either way it's whatever
Uh-huh,  yeah
Build me up and turn me on
You played me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine, o
You made me feel like I was yours
You made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
Woo!
You made me feel like I was yours
You made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
I could've sworn it was a dream
I would cut these girls off for you
If you say you wanted me too
I don't know what's changed with you
But something's different
Because you say that you miss me
Then you go and say that you can't kiss me
I don't understand, you're playing with me
Wish I didn't wish that you were with me
But I do, yeah
You could break my heart and I'd still come back to you, 
You could change your mind and I'd still wait here for you, 
And I hate the fact that all these things are true
And how long will it take to think of what you gonna say?
It's been a couple of days, I haven't heard from you
Was it something I said that made you get inside your head?
Girl, you're messing my head
And now it hurts when
You say you miss me
Then you go and say that you can't kiss me
I don't understand, you're playing with me
Wish I didn't wish that you were with me
But I do, yeah
You could break my heart and I'd still come back to you, 
You could change your mind and I'd still wait here for you, 
And I hate the fact that all these things are true
Why do I do this?
Pick you up and put you down and put you through this
Started off as a good thing, a sure thing, you held back but I know
In the moment our lips touched, the rush sent us straight to the moon
I should've known that we'd be coming down
Right to the bottom where we are now Hmm
Started off as a good thing, a sure thing, what the hell did I do? Yeah
Every time I think I love somebody
Always find a way to throw it all away
I don't ever wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna be the one to say
That we gotta have a conversation
I don't wanna watch the tears roll down your face
No, I hurt you, and I, I'm sorry
All I wanted was to love somebody
Why do I do this?
